# odin-recipes
This project didn't teach me a ton, but it is the beginning of becoming able to make sites on my own and engraving good coding habits. It is fairly tedious, but as the project went on i become much more used to the editor and the whole process and as a result, became much faster. This project was definatly worth it and I look forward to more challenging ones later on in the Odin Project.
